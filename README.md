<h1>Setting up Windows 10 Client</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
Setting up a Windows 10 client on VMware Workstation 17 Pro involves creating a new virtual machine, configuring hardware settings, installing Windows 10 from an ISO file, and installing VMware Tools for enhanced functionality. Once the Windows 10 client is set up, I will verify that its IP address is within the defined scope and ping the Windows Server to ensure connectivity between the two machines.
